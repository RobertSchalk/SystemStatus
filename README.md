**<h1>System Status</h1>**
I got bored and built this application to display certain statuses about my systems. It can currently pull the basic information about your system.



**<h2> How To: </h2>**<br>
To run the application, clone it, and run the following command within the directory: <br>

<code>npm install </code><br>

To start the program: type the following command within the program's directory:<br>
<code>npm start</code>
